# **Design Patterns Encyclopedia**

## **About the Project**

This repository is a comprehensive guide and practical demonstration of the 24 standard design patterns in software engineering, categorized into Creational, Structural, and Behavioral patterns. Each pattern is represented with code examples, detailed explanations, and real-world applications. This project aims to be a valuable resource for both beginners and experienced developers to understand and implement these patterns effectively in their software designs.
